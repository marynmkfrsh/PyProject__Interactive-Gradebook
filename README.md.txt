# Interactive Gradebook

**Maryam Namakforoosh**

*This very simple program is based on other similar projects on the internet. It has more functionality compared to those that I have seen so far, and from which it is inspired. The purpose of this project was practice and learning. The aesthetics are lacking. This is to practice some basic OOP, file manipulation, exceptions, logic, and programming concepts/flow. It is also a practice in legibility of code and documentation.*

The program requires a password to use. This password is contained in a local file called `shadow.txt`. Either include the file in the local directory or create such a text file and enter a password there. Note that the password can be manipulated from within the program.

The program uses a class called operations that contains multiple functions to work with/manipulate a dictionary. The dictionary is formatted to look like a simple gradebook. The gradebook is initialized at the beginning of the program.




To be added: GPA, aesthetic enhancement, better user experience(cf.Note)

Note: better user experience such as not returning to the main menu after an unacceptable input. I've fixed for some cases but there are others.
